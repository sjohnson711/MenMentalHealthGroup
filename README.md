## 📖 About The Project

The **Men's Group Companion** is a web application designed to bridge the gap for our Men's Mental Health Group. While we meet face-to-face once a month, mental health requires daily maintenance and support.

This platform serves as a hub for members to share testimonials, find immediate help, and access resources. It utilizes **Local Storage** to persist user data directly in the browser, ensuring a personalized experience without the need for a complex backend server in its initial phase.

### 🌟 Key Features

* **🚑 Crisis Support:** A prominent Suicide Help Line banner located in the top margin of every page for immediate access to life-saving resources.
* **💬 Community Testimonials:** A section for members to share their thoughts and encouragement.
    * *Tech Note:* Uses the browser's Local Storage to save and display testimonials instantly.
* **📱 Responsive Design:** Built to work on mobile and desktop devices.

## 🚧 Roadmap & Upcoming Features

This project is currently under active development. The following features are in progress:

- [ ] **Daily Articles:** Integration to fetch and display daily mental health articles curated specifically for men.
- [ ] **Therapist Finder:** A search tool to locate virtual or nearby therapists based on the user's location.
- [ ] **Personal Journal:** A private section for users to log their daily thoughts and feelings (using Local Storage).
- [ ] **Resource Library:** A static collection of recommended books and podcasts.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **HTML5** - Semantic markup for accessibility.
* **CSS3** - Custom styling and layout (Flexbox/Grid).
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** - DOM manipulation and logic.
* **LocalStorage API** - For persisting data (testimonials and future journal entries) on the client side.
